My edited version of WebUpdater.ino to upload .bin files to your NodeMCU via web browser

    Use this sketch to upload a .bin file to your ESP8266/NodeMCU via web browser

    Original file (WebUpdater.ino) to display IP Address and MAC Address in Serial Monitor, to make it easier
    to upload without having to find the board's IP Address from your Modem/Router.
