My edited version of WebUpdater.ino to upload .bin files to your NodeMCU via web browser

    Use this sketch to upload a .bin file to your ESP8266/NodeMCU via web browser

    Original file (WebUpdater.ino) modified to display IP Address and MAC Address
    in Serial Monitor, to make it easier to upload without having to find 
    the board's IP Address from your Modem/Router.
